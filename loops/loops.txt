To perform any task in repeatative manner
we use the Loops. Basically programming languages have 2 types of loops 
 1. Entry Controlled
 		The loop who looks for the condition to be satisfied before its execution
 		a. While
 		b. for - in
 2. Exit Controlled
 		The loop who looks for the condition to be satisfied after its execution that will decide the next iteration of loop..
 		a. do-while

1. WHILE - 
	works on condition, and it executes unless and until the condition does not get failed. It is indeterminate.

	Syntax - 
		while CONDITION:
			statement 1
			statement 2
			---
			statement N


2. FOR IN- 
	works on ranges. It is determinate loop. i.e. It is already having execution plan for start and end.

	Syntax -

		for i in range(START,END):
			body of the loop
	Example-

		for i in range(1,5):
			print(i)
	In above example i will assigned with 1 and prints 1. Then i gets assigned value 2 and prints 2. Then i gets assigned value 3 and prints 3. Then i gets assigned value 4 and prints 4. At last the END - 1 is 4 hence, loop will get terminated.
