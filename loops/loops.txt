To perform any task in repeatative manner
we use the Loops. Basically programming languages have 2 types of loops 
 1. Entry Controlled
 		The loop who looks for the condition to be satisfied before its execution
 		a. While
 		b. for - in
 2. Exit Controlled
 		The loop who looks for the condition to be satisfied after its execution that will decide the next iteration of loop..
 		a. do-while

1. WHILE - 
	works on condition, and it executes unless and until the condition does not get failed. It is indeterminate.
2. FOR - 
	works on ranges. It is determinate loop. i.e. It is already having execution plan for start and end.
